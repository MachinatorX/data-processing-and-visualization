# Intro

This document is for a workshop to provide some tools, tips, packages etc. that make data processing and visualization in R easier.  It is oriented toward those who have recently started out in R, but would also be useful to someone coming to R from another programming language.  It is *not* an introduction to R, nor does this document have anything to do with statistical analysis.

Note that this used to be slide-based, and so there are a lot of short sentences. I got tired of the limitations of slides for code and other presentation, so it is now in bookdown format.
