# Intro {-}

This document is the basis for multiple workshops, whose common goal is to provide some tools, tips, packages etc. that make data processing and visualization in R easier.  It is oriented toward those who have had some exposure to R in an applied data analysis fashion, but would also be useful to someone coming to R from another programming language.  It is *not* an introduction to R, nor does this document have anything to do with actual data analysis, though it is assumed that is one's goal (e.g. as opposed to software development).  The goal here is primarily to instill awareness, specifically of tools that will make your data exploration easier, and to understand some of the *why* behind the tools, so that one can better implement them.  It is meant to fill in some of the gaps 


Currently this document is undergoing some reorganization and extension.  

## Outline

### Part 1: Data Processing

#### Understanding Base R Approaches to Data Processing

- Overview of Data Structures
- Input/Output


####  Getting Acquainted with Other Approaches to Data Processing

- Pipes, and how to use them
- tidyverse
- data.table
- Misc.


### Part 2: Visualization

#### Thinking Visually

- Visualizing Information
- Color
- Contrast
- and more...

#### ggplot2

- Aesthetics
- Layers
- Themes
- and more...

#### Adding Interactivity

- Package demos
- Shiny


### Part 3: Programming Basics

#### Using R more fully

- Dealing with objects
- Iterative programming
- Writing functions

#### Going further

- Vectorization 
- Regular expressions


### Part 4: Presentation

Possible future addition

### Part 5: Modeling

Possible future addition



## Preparation

To follow along with the examples, complete the following steps:

- Download the zip file at https://github.com/m-clark/data-processing-and-visualization/raw/master/workshop_project.zip. Be mindful of where you put it.
- Unzip it. Be mindful of where you put the resulting folder.
- Open RStudio.
- File/Open Project and click on the blue icon (workshop_project.Rproj) in the folder you just created.
- File/Open Click on the ReadMe file, and, well, read it.

You will then have easy access to much of the data, code, etc. used in the examples.

Some key packages used in the following demonstrations and exercises:

<span class="pack">tidyverse</span> (several packages), <span class="pack">data.table</span>, <span class="pack">ggplot2movies</span> 

### Python

Python notebooks for the data processing section and visualization sections may be found [here](https://github.com/m-clark/data-processing-and-visualization/tree/master/code).


### R

Many other packages are also used, so feel free to install as we come across them. Here are a few.

<span class="pack">DT</span>, <span class="pack">highcharter</span>, <span class="pack">magrittr</span>, <span class="pack">maps</span>, <span class="pack">mgcv</span> (already comes with base R), <span class="pack">plotly</span>, <span class="pack">quantmod</span>, <span class="pack">readr</span>, <span class="pack">visNetwork</span>
