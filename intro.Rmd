# Intro {-}

This document is the basis for multiple workshops, whose common goal is to provide some tools, tips, packages etc. that make data processing, programming, modeling, visualization, and presentation in R easier.  It is oriented toward those who have had some exposure to R in an applied data analysis fashion, but would also be useful to someone coming to R from another programming language.  It is *not* an introduction to R.  The goal here is primarily to instill awareness, specifically of tools that will make your data exploration, modeling, and visualization easier, and to understand some of the *why* behind the tools, so that one can better implement them.  It is meant to fill in some of the gaps that typically befall applied users of R.

## Outline

- data.table
- Misc.

### Part 2: Programming Basics

#### Using R more fully

- Dealing with objects
- Iterative programming
- Writing functions

#### Going further

- Code style
- Vectorization 
- Regular expressions


### Part 3: Modeling

#### Model Exploration

- Key concepts
- Understanding and fitting models
- Overview of extensions

#### Model Criticism

- Model Comparison

#### Machine Learning 

- Concepts
- Demonstration of techniques


### Part 4: Visualization

#### Thinking Visually

- Visualizing Information
- Color
- Contrast
- and more...

#### ggplot2

- Aesthetics
- Layers
- Themes
- and more...

#### Adding Interactivity

- Package demos
- Shiny


### Part 5: Presentation

Possible future addition. [See this for now](https://m-clark.github.io/Introduction-to-Rmarkdown/).





## Preparation

To follow along with the examples, clone/download the related section repos.  Downloading any one of them will have an R project and associated data, such that the code from any section should run.

Some key packages used in the following demonstrations and exercises:

<span class="pack">tidyverse</span> (several packages), <span class="pack">data.table</span>, <span class="pack">ggplot2movies</span> 

### Python

Python notebooks for the data processing section and visualization sections may be found [here](https://github.com/m-clark/data-processing-and-visualization/tree/master/code).


### R

Many other packages are also used, so feel free to install as we come across them. Here are a few.

<span class="pack">tidymodels</span>, <span class="pack">nycflights13</span>, <span class="pack">DT</span>, <span class="pack">highcharter</span>, <span class="pack">magrittr</span>, <span class="pack">maps</span>, <span class="pack">mgcv</span> (already comes with base R), <span class="pack">plotly</span>, <span class="pack">quantmod</span>, <span class="pack">readr</span>, <span class="pack">visNetwork</span>
