# Intro {-}

This document provides some tools, demonstrations, and more to make data processing, programming, modeling, visualization, and presentation easier.  The goal here is to instill a knowledge foundation for sound data science, and also to provide some of the *why* behind the tools, so that one can better implement them. 


While the programming language focus is on R, where applicable (which is most of the time), Python notebooks are also available, and much of the actual content would apply to any programming language used for data science, and concepts for programming, modeling, visualization, reproducibility and more are applicable for anyone engaged in data science.

## Preparation

To follow along with the examples, clone/download the related section repos.  Downloading any one of them will have an R project and associated data, such that the code from any section should run.

### History

This was initial a document that only contained the information processing and visualization chapters and. Over time, it has increased to include other things I think are generally missing from those who simply learn how to get to the end results.  The content is born out of the gaps I see in those I consult with, and also just 'I wish I'd known that' type of experience.
