# Practical Data Science

The focus of this document is on using R for data processing, programming, modeling, visualization, and presentation of results. It contains exercises for additional practice, and most of the content has been translated to **Python** and is available via [Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/m-clark/data-processing-and-visualization/tree/master/jupyter_notebooks).
