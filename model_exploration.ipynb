The $\\epsilon$ represents the *error* or *residual*.  We don't have perfect prediction, and that represents the difference between what we can guess with our predictor relationships to the target and what we actually observe with it.\n",

    "In Python, we specify a linear model as we would in R using [the formula api](https://www.statsmodels.org/devel/example_formulas.html).  There are various inputs, typically starting with the formula. In the formula, The target variable is first, followed by the predictor variables, separated by a tilde (`~`). Additional predictor variables are added with a plus sign (`+`).  In this example, `y` is our target, and the predictors are `x` and `z`."
