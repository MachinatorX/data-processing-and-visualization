## Basic Programming

We have already explored some basic programming, some of which we'll revisit here, but now we'll branch out a bit as well.


- Iterative programming
- Writing functions
- Efficient programming
    - Code style
    - Compartmentalization
    - Naming
  
  
Move vectorization/apply section here?  Incorporate purrr/map/do.
