## Miscellaneous

(SECTION DEVELOPMENT IN PROGRESS)

Brief descriptions of other packages and tools that might be useful in data processing.

### MOAR TIDY

- dplyr functions: There are over a hundred functions that perform very common tasks.  You really need to be aware of them as their use will come up often.
- broom: Convert statistical analysis objects from R into tidy data frames, so that they can more easily be combined, reshaped and otherwise processed with tools like dplyr, tidyr and ggplot2.
- tidy*: a lot of packages out there that are now 'tidy', though not a part of the official tidyverse. Some examples of the ones I've used:
    - tidycensus
    - tidybayes
    - tidytext
    - modelr
    
Seriously, there's [a lot](https://www.r-pkg.org/search.html?q=tidy).
