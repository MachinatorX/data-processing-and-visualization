# Intro

This document is for a workshop the goal of which is to provide some tools, tips, packages etc. that make data processing and visualization in R easier.  It is oriented toward those who have had some exposure to R in an applied fashion, but would also be useful to someone coming to R from another programming language.  It is *not* an introduction to R, nor does this document have anything to do with statistical analysis.  The goal here is primarily to instill awareness, specifically of tools that will make your data exploration easier, and to understand some of the *why* behind the tools, so that one can better implement them.
