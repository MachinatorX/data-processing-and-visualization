    "$$\\mathcal{Loss} = \\Sigma(y - \\hat{y})^2 + \\lambda\\cdot\\Sigma\\beta^2$$\n",

    "In the above, this is the same squared error loss function as before, but we add a penalty that is based on the size of the coefficients.  So, while initially our loss goes down with some set of estimates, the penalty based on their size might be such that the estimated loss actually increases. This has the effect of shrinking the estimates toward zero. Well, [why would we want that](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/179864/why-does-shrinkage-work)?  This introduces [bias in the coefficients](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/207760/when-is-a-biased-estimator-preferable-to-unbiased-one), but the end result is a model that will do better on test set prediction, which is the goal of the ML approach. The way this works regards the bias-variance tradeoff we discussed previously.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The following demonstrates regularized regression using the just the basic `statsmodels` approach. It actually uses *elastic net*, which has a mixture of two penalties, one of which is the squared sum of coefficients (typically called *ridge regression*, as above) and the other is the sum of their absolute values (the so-called *lasso*). The `L1_wt` varies the relative amount of lasso and ridge regression (1 = lasso, 0 = ridge). `alpha` is the actual penalty amount."

    "A limitation of standard linear models, especially with many input variables, is that there's not a real automatic way to incorporate interactions and nonlinearities.  So we often will want to use techniques that do so.  To understand *random forests* and similar techniques (boosted trees, etc.), we can start with a simple decision tree.  To begin, for a single input variable (`X1`) whose range might be 1 to 10, we find that a cut at 5.75 results in the best classification, such that if all observations greater than or equal to 5.75 are classified as positive, and the rest negative. This general approach is fairly straightforward and conceptually easy to grasp, and it is because of this that tree approaches are appealing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let’s add a second input (`X2`), also on a 1 to 10 range. We now might find that even better classification results if, upon looking at the portion of data regarding those greater than or equal to 5.75, that we only classify positive if they are also less than 3 on the second variable. The following is a hypothetical tree reflecting this."

    "This tree structure allows for both interactions between variables, and nonlinear relationships between some input and the target variable (e.g. the second branch could just be the same `X1` but with some cut value greater than 5.75).  Random forests randomly select a few from the available input variables, and create a tree that minimizes (maximizes) some loss (objective) function on a validation set.  A given tree can potentially be very wide/deep, but instead of just one tree, we now do, say, 1000 trees. A final prediction is made based on the average across all trees. \n",

    "We demonstrate the random forest again using `scikit-learn`.  As before, we can tune some of the parameters, in this case, the number of predictors to randomly select each tree and how many observations should be in each leaf."

    "*Neural networks* have been around for a long while as a general concept in artificial intelligence and even as a machine learning algorithm, and often work quite well. In some sense, neural networks can simply be thought of as nonlinear regression. Visually however, we can see them as a graphical model with layers of inputs and outputs. Weighted combinations of the inputs are created and put through some function (e.g. the sigmoid function) to produce the next layer of inputs. This next layer goes through the same process to produce either another layer, or to predict the output, or even multiple outputs, which serves as the final layer. All the layers between the input and output are usually referred to as hidden layers. If there were a single hidden layer with a single unit and no transformation, then it becomes the standard regression problem."
