## Workshop Project folder for the Presentation Section

This folder contains an RStudio project. You have access to the following:

- All data files used in the notes
- A package installation script (likely not necessary)
- Exercises

This part of the series and document is distinct from the others in that there is no specific data processing, programming, modeling, or visualization to conduct.  Basically you just want to get the hang of creating a Markdown document on your own. To that end, you can just open RStudio and click `File/New File/R Markdown` and you're on your way.  However, exercises are included in the `exercises.Rmd` file.
